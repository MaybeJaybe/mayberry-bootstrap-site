Site commissioned by my brother as a fun family project. mainly for design and merch ideas for family events.

## To Do

### Nav:
- change hover color mayberry & sons nav
- add logo when finished

### Home:
- no image shows up when in live site

### Gallery:
- cards still dont fit phone screen size, worse than i thought (much more scrolling than on tiny desktop window)
- cards spacing in between is bad
- cards some images squished weird 
- carousel images resizing to right rather than centered on mobile
- carousel doesnt display descriptive text
- maybe make carousel buttons smaller on mobile?
- also carousel buttons should unclick when not pushed (stays transparent after click on desktop and mobile)

### About:

- text card overlaps image
- possible logo placement potential here
- contact us not enough padding at bottom
- modal needs better styling
- modal on click save - send and clear form
